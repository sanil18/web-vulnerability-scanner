This Python script is a robust web vulnerability scanner designed to assess the security of a website by utilizing various powerful modules. The scanner incorporates the following key features:

Key Features
SQL Injection Scanner: The scanner leverages the requests module for making HTTP requests and utilizes Beautiful Soup for effective web scraping. It searches for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by analyzing the HTML content for common SQL keywords.

Phishing Detection with Machine Learning: Using the scikit-learn library, the script employs machine learning to predict and report phishing attempts. Real-time phishing data from the PhishTank API is fetched, providing an enhanced layer of security.

Domain Age Checker: The tldextract module is employed to extract domain information from URLs, while the python-whois module retrieves registration details. By calculating the age of the domain, the scanner assesses its potential vulnerability.
