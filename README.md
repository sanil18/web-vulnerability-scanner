Web Vulnerability Scanner
Overview
This Python script is a simple web vulnerability scanner that checks a given website for potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, outdated software versions, and phishing attempts. The script uses various libraries and techniques, including web scraping, machine learning, and API integration.

Features
SQL Injection Scanner: Identifies potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by searching for common SQL keywords in the HTML content of the target website.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Scanner: Placeholder for XSS scanning logic. You can enhance this section to include XSS vulnerability checks.

Outdated Software Scanner: Placeholder for version checking logic. You can extend this to check for outdated software versions.

Phishing Detection: Uses a machine learning classifier trained on real-time phishing data obtained from the PhishTank API to predict phishing attempts.

Domain Age Checker: Retrieves and calculates the age of the domain to assess its potential vulnerability.

Usage
Install the required Python modules:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn tldextract python-whois
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Provide the target URL when prompted.

Dependencies
Requests: For making HTTP requests.

Beautiful Soup: For web scraping.

scikit-learn: For machine learning classification.

tldextract: For extracting domain information from URLs.

python-whois: For retrieving domain registration information.

Notes
The XSS and outdated software scanning sections are placeholders and can be extended to include more advanced vulnerability checks.

Ensure that you have an internet connection for real-time phishing data fetching.

This project is a basic demonstration and can be extended for more comprehensive vulnerability scanning.
